# learning machine learning

Files in the repository contain my exercises in a field of machine learning etc.
Files are commented in polish.

## konie (horses) -  jupyter notebooks (Python)
contain analysis of the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Horse+Colic <br/>
the analysis is strongly influenced by: https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/horse-survival-prediction-top-ml-models and https://www.kaggle.com/sabasiddiqi/data-examination-and-cleaning <br/>
2 versions- with and without upsampling of the unbalanced dataset,  
the upsampling offers increase in accuracy metric from 50-72 to 69-92 (depending on the method used) <br/>
### applied methods:
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, K Nearest Neighbours, Gradient Boosting & Extreme Gradient Boosting


## WDBC - R
contain analysis of the dataset presented at: https://www.kaggle.com/mohaiminul101/wisconsin-diagnostic-breast-cancer-wdbc
### applied methods:
K-Nearest Neighbours, neural networks & logistic regression
